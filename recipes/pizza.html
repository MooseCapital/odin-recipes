        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Making homemade pizza dough can sound like a lot of work, but it’s so worth the bragging rights. The dough itself requires few ingredients and just a little bit of rising and rest time</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
                <li>7 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>28 oz canned whole tomatoes</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>“Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water.</li>
                <li>Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven as high as your oven will allow, between 450-500˚F</li>
                <li>Add the salt to the can of tomatoes and puree with an immersion blender, </li>
            </ol>
